# This file is used to manage paths to the various pages in the your application. 
# Paths set here can be refered to by their name in steps such as:
#             Given I am on the "form" page
#                      OR
#             Then I should be redirected to the "other" page
# Both "form" and "other" in these examples are looked up in this file during test case execution. 
# If they are not found, the test case will fail.
# You can provide both full URLs and relative paths in this file. For example, you can point to external links
# like this:
# google_maps: http://maps.google.com
# When providing URLs, you must provide the full URL (including http or https)
# In most cases though, it makes more sense to simply provide a relative path like:
#  search: '/search.html'
# If the current environment is set to:
#  Production: 'http://your production url.com'
# Then the "search" page in this example is understood to be
#   'http://your production url.com/search.html'
# This file must be valid YAML
# You can read about YAML syntax here: http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/YAMLSyntax.html
# This YAML checker may come in handy too: http://yamllint.com/
